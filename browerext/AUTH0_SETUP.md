4. Give it a name like "ThreadMirror Extension"

   https://*.chromiumapp.org/
   ```

2. **Allowed Logout URLs**:

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Authorization page could not be loaded"

This error usually means:

1. **‚ùå Wrong Auth0 Domain**
   - Check your domain in `.env.local`
   - Should be like: `your-domain.auth0.com`
   - Verify it exists at https://manage.auth0.com/

2. **‚ùå Wrong Client ID**
   - Copy the exact Client ID from Auth0 dashboard
   - It should be a long string (30+ characters)

3. **‚ùå Missing Callback URLs**
   - Add `https://*.chromiumapp.org/` to Auth0 settings
   - Save the settings in Auth0 dashboard

4. **‚ùå Environment variables not loaded**
   - Make sure `.env.local` exists
   - Rebuild after changing environment variables
   - Variables must start with `VITE_`

### Check Current Configuration

Open the extension popup and check the console (F12) for debug logs that show your current configuration.

### Test Auth0 Configuration

You can test your Auth0 configuration by visiting:
```
https://YOUR-DOMAIN.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback&scope=openid%20profile%20email
```

Replace `YOUR-DOMAIN` and `YOUR-CLIENT-ID` with your actual values.
